# Export custom data in GraphML - Application Features

<img src="../../../doc/demo-thumbnails/custom-graphml.webp" alt="demo-thumbnail" height="320"/>

[You can also run this demo online](https://www.yworks.com/demos/application-features/custom-graphml/).

This step shows how to [read and write data](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/customizing_io_serialization-basics) that is bound to graph elements to and from a GraphML file.

This is demonstrated with Date objects that are bound to the node by an [IMapper](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/IMapper). Place the cursor over a node to view the bound object in a tooltip.

See the sources for details.
