# Graph Search - Application Features

<img src="../../../doc/demo-thumbnails/graph-search.webp" alt="demo-thumbnail" height="320"/>

[You can also run this demo online](https://www.yfiles.com/demos/application-features/graph-search/).

This demo shows an implementation of the search functionality on the nodes of a graph.

The search is performed on the labels of the nodes and those that match the queried term are being highlighted.

There exists also a separate graph search implementation in `demos-js/utils` package currently used by [these demos](../../README.html#search). This implementation can be extended to support custom search on graph elements.

See the sources for details.
