          <h1>Jest Demo</h1>

          <p>
            The Jest demo shows how to use <a target="_blank" href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a> for
            unit testing a yFiles for HTML application.
          </p>

          <p>To run the unit tests:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Go to the demo's directory <code>demos-js/testing/jest</code>.</li>
            <li>Run <code>npm install</code>.</li>
            <li>Run the unit tests with <code>npm run test</code>.</li>
          </ol>

          <h2>yFiles and Jest</h2>
          <p>
            While modern JavaScript (or TypeScript) applications usually use JavaScript modules,
            Jest's support for native JavaScript modules is still experimental. For this reason,
            JavaScript modules code is transpiled. Due to its size, transpiling the yFiles
            JavaScript modules library is rather slow.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some parts of yFiles require a complete DOM implementation, which Jest's JSDOM
            environment does not provide. To still be able to test code that uses yFiles API that
            require a DOM, it is necessary to mock yFiles. See the
            <code>tests/ItemFactoryWithMock.test.js</code> file for details.
