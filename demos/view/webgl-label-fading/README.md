# WebGL Label Fading Demo - yFiles for HTML

<img src="../../../doc/demo-thumbnails/webgl-label-fading.webp" alt="demo-thumbnail" height="320"/>

[You can also run this demo online](https://www.yfiles.com/demos/view/webgl-label-fading/).

This demo shows how to achieve a simple _level of detail (LOD)_ display in [WebGL](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/dguide/webgl2) rendering by fading out labels, nodes, and edges at certain zoom levels.

## Things to try

- Zoom into the graph and observe as labels are faded in, along with additional layers in the tree.
- Note that labels also do not visually scale at certain zoom levels so that they are more legible.
- Opposed to nodes and edges, labels will hide again when zoomed in too close.

See the sources for details.
