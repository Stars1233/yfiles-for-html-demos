# Lasso Selection Demo - yFiles for HTML

<img src="../../../doc/demo-thumbnails/lasso-selection.webp" alt="demo-thumbnail" height="320"/>

[You can also run this demo online](https://www.yfiles.com/demos/input/lasso-selection/).

This demo shows how to use [LassoSelectionInputMode](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/api/LassoSelectionInputMode) to select graph elements by drawing a lasso around them.

## Things to Try

- Choose between different **Selection Styles** using the toolbar dropdown:
  - **Free-hand:** Draw a free-form shape around elements by dragging the mouse.
  - **Polyline:** Create a polygon by clicking to add points. Double-click to complete the selection.
  - **Marquee:** Use the traditional rectangular selection by dragging the mouse.

- Determine how nodes are considered **selected** by the lasso tool using the toolbar dropdown:
  - **Fully Contained:** Nodes are selected only if fully contained within the lasso path.
  - **Intersected:** Nodes are selected if they intersect the lasso path.
  - **Center Contained:** Nodes are selected only if their center point is contained within the lasso path.

- **Finish Radius:** Adjust the radius around the starting point where the lasso can be closed. When dragging the lasso near the starting point, a circle with the corresponding radius is highlighted.
