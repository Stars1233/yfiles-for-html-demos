            <h1>Vite Lazy Load yFiles</h1>

            <p>
              This demo shows how to lazy load yFiles with
              <a href="https://vitejs.dev/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Vite</a>'s
              <a href="https://vite.dev/guide/features#dynamic-import/" target="_blank"
                >dynamic import</a
              >
              feature.
            </p>

            <p>
              By default, vite automatically performs tree-shaking and only includes the necessary
              modules for production builds.
            </p>
            <p>
              Often, the diagram component is not needed for the initial startup of the application
              or can be loaded lazily in general to provide a better user experience. Thus, in this
              case, yFiles is only loaded when the diagram component of this application is
              requested.
            </p>
            <p>The demo loads yFiles only if users click the 'Lazy Load yFiles' button.</p>

            <h2>Dynamic Imports with yFiles</h2>
            <p>There are two possible approaches:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create a separate diagram component that imports from the
                <code>yfiles</code> meta module.
                <br />
                This separate diagram component with yFiles can then be loaded dynamically on demand
                which is demonstrated in this application.
              </li>
              <li>
                yFiles can also be split up further, such that only specific
                <a
                  href="https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/dguide/yfiles-modules#es-modules"
                  target="_blank"
                  >yFiles ES modules</a
                >
                are loaded when needed, e.g., initially only load the yFiles view, but lazy load the
                yFiles layout if needed.
              </li>
            </ul>
