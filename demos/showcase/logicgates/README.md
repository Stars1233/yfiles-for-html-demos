# Logic Gates Demo

<img src="../../../doc/demo-thumbnails/logic-gates.webp" alt="demo-thumbnail" height="320"/>

[You can also run this demo online](https://www.yworks.com/demos/showcase/logicgates/).

This demo showcases yFiles for HTML to visualize a digital system with logic gates.

Each node has specific ports: incoming edges connect only to the left side of the target node, while outgoing edges go to the right side of the source node. [LayoutPortCandidate](https://docs.yworks.com/yfileshtml/#/api/LayoutPortCandidate) is used for this purpose.

## Graph Creation

A [Port-aware Graph Builder Demo](../../databinding/port-aware-graph-builder/) is used to create the graph, connecting the edges with specific ports defined in the business data.

## Things to Try

- Drag nodes from the palette and connect them with edges.
- Create a new edge: this highlights the possible end ports with green color.
- Hover over a node to see available input (reddish color) and output (bluish color) ports
- Reassign a connection by selecting the edge and dragging its endpoint.
- The ports remain unchanged when applying the selected layout algorithm.
